# Decoherence as First Principle

A concise notebook on decoherence as a first principle â€” from quantum foundations to cosmology.

## Abstract {#abstract}

*What if cosmic structure arises from quantum decoherence itself?*

This project presents a new theoretical framework where ontological decoherence underlies gravity, dark matter, and the forces shaping our universe.

## Introduction {#introduction}

The fundamental question we address is whether decoherence can serve as a first principle from which classical physics, gravity, and cosmological structure emerge naturally.

## Key Concepts {#key-concepts}

- **Ontological Decoherence**: Not just measurement-induced, but fundamental to reality
- **Emergent Gravity**: Gravitational effects arising from decoherence processes
- **Dark Matter Alternative**: Structure formation through decoherence mechanisms
- **Unified Framework**: Single principle explaining multiple phenomena
