# Decoherence as First Principle: A Framework for Emergent Forces, Dark Matter, and Cosmological Structure

**What if cosmic structure arises from quantum decoherence itself?**

This project presents a new theoretical framework where ontological decoherence underlies gravity, dark matter, and the forces shaping our universe.
