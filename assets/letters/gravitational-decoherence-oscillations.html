<h1 class="title">Gravitational Decoherence Oscillations as the Source
of Apparent Cosmic Acceleration</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Letter from the Ongoing Work: August 2025</strong></p>
<p>I’m writing to share a theoretical framework I’ve been developing
that may offer a natural explanation for observed cosmic acceleration
and the Hubble tension—<em>without invoking a cosmological constant,
scalar fields, or exotic matter</em>. Instead, it builds on the
foundation of decoherence theory and gravitational dominance in
early-universe evolution.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary-of-the-approach">Summary of the Approach</h3>
<p>In this framework, the evolution of classicality in the universe is
governed by <strong>decoherence</strong> in a <strong>gravitationally
dominant pointer basis</strong>, with all electromagnetic observations
treated as projections from this underlying scaffold.</p>
<p>The system obeys a conservation principle involving classical energy
and entropy induced by decoherence:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{d}{dt}\left(E_\text{classical} + \alpha
S_\text{decoherence}\right) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>This law applies across epochs—from pre-EM stabilization through to
the present—and enables us to model the collapse-length (which sets the
decoherence timescale) as the principal variable tracking the expansion
of classical structure.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="collapse-length-as-a-dynamical-variable">Collapse-Length as a
Dynamical Variable</h3>
<p>We define a time-evolving collapse length <span
class="math inline">\(L_c(t)\)</span>, which determines the scale over
which quantum systems become classical. Our working hypothesis is that
the apparent acceleration of the universe arises from <strong>nonlinear
dynamics in</strong> <strong><span
class="math inline">\(L_c(t)\)</span></strong> that distort time
measurements in EM-local reference frames.</p>
<p>The first-order model treats this as a harmonic oscillator:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L_c&#39;&#39;(t) + \omega^2 L_c(t) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>With:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E_\text{classical} \propto
\frac{1}{L_c^2}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(S_\text{decoherence} \propto \ln
L_c\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This system yields a <strong>nearly conserved</strong> composite
function, indicating that cosmic expansion effects may emerge as
oscillations in the collapse-length field.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="introducing-damping-modeling-entropy-production">Introducing
Damping: Modeling Entropy Production</h3>
<p>To model entropy production over time—a manifestation of the
universe’s increasing irreversibility—we extend the model to a
<strong>damped harmonic oscillator</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L_c&#39;&#39;(t) + \gamma L_c&#39;(t) + \omega^2 L_c(t) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>Among the three possible damping regimes—overdamped, critically
damped, and underdamped—the <strong>underdamped</strong> case is most
physically compelling for cosmology. In this regime, <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma &lt; 2\omega\)</span>, the collapse length
oscillates while gradually decaying, resembling a universe with
repeating periods of accelerated and decelerated expansion, subtly
damped by increasing entropy:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L_c(t) = A e^{-\gamma t / 2} \cos\left(\Omega t + \phi\right), \quad
\Omega = \sqrt{\omega^2 - \frac{\gamma^2}{4}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Why underdamped? Because it reflects a universe that retains memory
of its prior quantum states—via oscillatory behavior—while steadily
dissipating usable energy. The damping encodes entropy production, while
the oscillation reflects dynamic structure formation. Critically damped
or overdamped systems would imply a rapid loss of decoherence dynamics,
inconsistent with the persistence of measurable cosmic anomalies like
redshift discrepancies. Underdamped motion thus mirrors our
observational reality: subtle, persistent deviation from
equilibrium.</p>
<p>Here:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the
entropy-generating damping coefficient,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is the intrinsic
decoherence oscillation frequency,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(L_c(t)\)</span> governs perceived
classicality and cosmic time.</li>
</ul>
<p>This function introduces <em>natural clock drift</em> between
gravitational and EM pointer bases. Observers embedded in the EM-local
frame interpret this drift as cosmic acceleration.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="consequences-and-observational-signatures">Consequences and
Observational Signatures</h3>
<p>This model predicts that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Redshift discrepancies</strong> (e.g., Hubble tension) may
stem from misalignment between gravitational and EM decoherence
rates.</li>
<li>The <strong>CMB anisotropy field</strong> reflects the phase and
amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(L_c(t)\)</span> at the moment
of EM pointer basis stabilization.</li>
<li>The long-term behavior of the universe—accelerating, flattening, or
turning—depends on the damping ratio <span class="math inline">\(\gamma
/ \omega\)</span> and initial phase <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key insight is that the <strong>least-action solution</strong>
for gravitational decoherence may present itself as an
<strong>underlying oscillation</strong>, not a static expansion force.
This offers a falsifiable alternative to <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>CDM under the right empirical
conditions.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p>This approach reframes the cosmological constant problem as one of
<strong>pointer basis misinterpretation</strong>—not missing energy.
It’s grounded in a first-principles conservation law, produces
dark-energy-like dynamics from decoherence itself, and gives us a new
handle on interpreting observational discrepancies.</p>
<p>I’m currently developing numerical simulations to estimate allowed
<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, and boundary conditions based on
known cosmic epochs and entropy growth patterns.</p>
<hr />
<p>If this resonates with your interests, I’d be grateful for the
opportunity to share a more formal preprint or collaborate on exploring
its empirical implications.</p>
<p>Warm regards,<br />
