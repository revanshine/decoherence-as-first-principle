<p><strong>Letter from the Ongoing Work: August 2025</strong></p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to share a line of
thought that extends from my recent work on the <em>Decoherence as First
Principle</em> framework, with a focus on the long-standing puzzle of
the relationship between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host
galaxies.</p>
<p>As you know, the empirical evidence is clear: black hole mass
correlates tightly with bulge stellar velocity dispersion (the <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>–<span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> relation), reasonably with bulge
mass, and in some cases with halo properties such as circular velocity.
This has often been interpreted in terms of coevolution and AGN
feedback. Yet the causal mechanisms remain debated, especially given the
vast spatial scales involved and the presence of outliers such as
pseudobulges.</p>
<p>Within the decoherence-bootstrap framework, these observations take
on a different character. If we treat gravity as the first stabilized
pointer basis, then both SMBH growth and bulge dispersion are natural
co-products of the same early gravitational decoherence events. In this
view:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The tight <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>–<span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> relation</strong> reflects two
parallel registers of the same gravitational potential depth—the
decoherence budget of the nucleus—rather than a purely
feedback-regulated equilibrium.</li>
<li><strong>Links to halo properties</strong> arise because the halo
concentration and circular velocity encode the earliest gravitational
pointer-state architecture, predating electromagnetic stabilization.
Black hole and host are thus co-imprinted by the same gravitationally
classical scaffolding.</li>
<li><strong>Scatter from pseudobulges</strong> emerges naturally:
systems whose late-time (EM-era) assembly dominates have weaker ties to
the early gravitational framework, so they deviate from the tight
relation established in classical bulges.</li>
<li><strong>High-redshift overmassive black holes</strong> may be
understood as a timing effect. During epochs of extremely short collapse
length, SMBHs could outpace electromagnetic-anchored stellar assembly,
with the apparent ratio later balanced as EM-era processes caught up

</ul>
<p>This interpretation reframes AGN feedback not as the origin of the
scaling relations but as a regulator of scatter. The scaling itself is
inherited from the gravitational pointer basis, a kind of cosmological
memory embedded in early decoherence dynamics.</p>
<p>Several testable implications follow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At fixed <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, SMBH mass
should correlate with halo concentration or inner density slope—hard to
explain with feedback alone.</li>
<li>Environment (e.g., cosmic web nodes) should leave residual imprints:
galaxies formed in deeper early gravitational wells should host
proportionally larger SMBHs.</li>
<li>Redshift evolution of <span
class="math inline">\(M_{BH}/M_\star\)</span> ratios should largely
vanish when conditioning on gravitational-depth proxies, rather than
EM-visible stellar mass.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Dark Epoch as Horizon: Why Early SMBHs Aren’t a
Mystery</strong></p>
<p>Much attention has been given to the discovery of billion-solar-mass
SMBHs less than a billion years after the Big Bang. These are often
portrayed as a profound puzzle, since their growth rates in the EM-era
appear inconsistent with the short time available. In the
decoherence-bootstrap framework, however, the mystery dissolves. Before
the stabilization of the electromagnetic pointer basis, conservation
laws as we understand them were not yet enforced. Gravity alone provided
a classical scaffold, and SMBHs emerged immediately as the natural
outcome of failed experiments in stability—runaway gravitational
collapse in a universe without electromagnetic feedback. Only with the
arrival of the EM-era did regulatory mechanisms such as radiation
pressure and winds begin to restrain their growth. Just as the horizon
of a black hole terminates decoherence by sending collapse length to
infinity, the dark epoch of the early universe reflects its mirror:
collapse length vanishingly short, decoherence hyperactive, conservation
not yet fixed. In this symmetry, early SMBHs are not anomalies but
necessities—the natural boundary conditions of a universe learning its
laws.</p>
<p><strong>The Universe Learns Its Own Laws</strong></p>
<p>This idea resonates with a broader perspective now emerging at the
intersection of cosmology and quantum information. In the earliest
epochs, conditions were undifferentiated—constants and couplings (<span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) were not yet fixed or meaningful.
With each <em>frame</em> of cosmic evolution, quantum-gravitational
interactions selected configurations that maximized stability and
persistence of classical reality. Physical constants may thus have
<em>locked in</em> as the universe underwent a form of symmetry breaking
and self-organization, settling into rules that support structure,
chemistry, and memory. In this sense, the apparent fine-tuning of the
Standard Model and cosmological constants is not accidental, but the
outcome of a learning-like process: classical branches persist because
those parameter sets allow durable records and observers. This echoes

<p>Infalling matter near a black hole undergoes the strongest possible
classicalization. In terms of the decoherence framework, this
corresponds to a collapse length approaching zero. At the event horizon,
however, the situation changes qualitatively: the collapse length
diverges, and decoherence events no longer occur. To an external
observer, this manifests as matter appearing to freeze at the horizon
due to extreme gravitational time dilation. From the perspective of the
infalling system, individuality is erased as all mass-energy contributes
to a single unresolved pointer state at the center of mass. In this
sense, the Big Bang can be regarded as the initiation of decoherence,
while black holes represent its termination. The sequence of collapse
events between these two extremes constitutes what we conventionally
describe as time.</p>
<p><strong>Note on Time as a Parameter Near Horizons</strong></p>
<p>In flat space or laboratory systems, Lindblad evolution is written
with respect to coordinate time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.
Near an event horizon, however, time becomes a treacherous parameter.
From the perspective of a distant observer, infalling clocks slow
asymptotically, never crossing the horizon; from the perspective of the
infaller, proper time ticks normally until termination at the
singularity. These two descriptions cannot be reconciled with a single
universal <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. What remains
well-defined is the progression along a worldline (proper time <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> for massive particles, affine
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> for photons).
Thus, when describing decoherence in strong-gravity regimes, it is more
natural to write Lindblad-type evolution against <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. Close to horizons, time in the
global sense loses meaning as a smooth parameter; only trajectory-based
evolution remains physically coherent.</p>
<p>I am under no illusion that these ideas solve the coevolution puzzle
outright, but they may offer a new perspective: that the SMBH–galaxy
connection is, at root, a record of the universe’s first successful
decoherence channel—gravity—and the structures that stabilized under
it.</p>
<p>I would welcome your thoughts, criticisms, or pointers toward related
work.</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>
