<p><strong>Collapse-Length Oscillation and Conservation-Driven
Cosmological Expansion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Letter from the Ongoing Work: August 2025</strong></p>
<p>In 2025, we find ourselves in the curious position of having access
to data that Einstein, Dirac, or Feynman would have wept to see — yet
still unsure how to interpret its deeper meaning. The universe continues
to expand, and light from the early cosmos continues to surprise us. The
tension between different measurements of the Hubble constant — most
notably those from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and local
distance ladder — suggests a discrepancy, one stubborn to conventional
resolution.</p>
<p>This letter proposes a new framing: that the discrepancy may not stem
from observational error or unknown local dynamics, but from a
<strong>first-principles cosmological phenomenon</strong> — a
<em>collapse-length oscillator</em>, subtly but persistently influencing
how decoherence propagates over time, and thus how information is
preserved and transmitted through cosmic expansion.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the decoherence framework introduced in
“Decoherence as First Principle” admits a natural dynamical structure:
an underdamped harmonic oscillator governing the collapse length, <span
class="math inline">\(\ell(t)\)</span>, constrained by a conservation
law:</p>
<p>The <strong>total classical energy</strong> stored in pointer states
<strong>plus</strong> a scaled entropy term remains constant in
time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dt} \left[
E_{\text{class}}(t) + k \cdot S(t) \right] = 0\)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This constraint implies a shift of ‘reality weight’ from
deterministic classical structure to thermodynamic uncertainty, and
suggests that the very fabric of spacetime might wobble in a way that
leaves a measurable fingerprint. The ‘collapse length’ that defines how
classicality emerges from quantum systems could itself oscillate as a
function of time — perhaps only once, perhaps with subtle damped cycles,
governed by initial conditions at or near the Big Bang.</p>
<p>We model this using the familiar damped harmonic oscillator:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(\ell&#39;&#39;(t) + 2\gamma
\ell&#39;(t) + \omega^2 \ell(t) = 0\)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the damping
coefficient and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> the natural
frequency. Our guiding intuition is that this equation, coupled to the
conservation constraint above, gives rise to a time-dependent deviation
from a purely geometric expansion — one that might explain the Hubble
tension without invoking new particles or dark sectors.</p>
<p>In this framing, light traveling through the universe accumulates its
history through a lens subtly modulated by collapse length dynamics —
and this modulation introduces tiny distortions in our cosmological
measurements. These distortions could be interpreted as mismatches in
Hubble measurements — but they may in fact be the long echo of a cosmic
oscillator.</p>
<p>This is not an appeal to magic, nor to metaphysics. The beauty of
this proposal is that it is testable — if one can formalize the
collapse-length evolution function, couple it to entropy production, and
simulate its cumulative effect on observationally-derived distances.</p>
<p>We now begin that work, building a software framework to test this
model against real redshift data and evaluate whether a simple
conservation-guided oscillator could reconcile the measurement
divergence. If it does not — so be it. But if it does, it would be a
smile-worthy echo of scientific history: not a new particle, not a new
force, but a new <strong>frame of interpretation</strong> that links
quantum theory, decoherence, entropy, and cosmology.</p>
<p>We do not seek fame, only clarity. Einstein worried not about credit,
but correctness. And if we are wrong, let us be gloriously, precisely
wrong — with enough rigor that someone else can set it right.</p>
