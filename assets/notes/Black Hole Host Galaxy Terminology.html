Terminology</h1>
<h2 id="definition-of-host">Definition of “Host”</h2>
<p>In the phrase <strong>“black hole and host”</strong> (especially in
the context of galaxies), the term <strong>host</strong> almost always
refers to the <strong>host galaxy</strong>—that is, the galaxy which
contains the black hole, typically a <em>supermassive black hole</em> at
its center.</p>
<h2 id="what-host-encompasses">What “Host” Encompasses</h2>
<p><strong>“Host” in this context means:</strong> - The <strong>entire
galaxy</strong> that surrounds and includes the central black hole - The
gravitational and dynamical environment in which the black hole resides
- The stellar, gas, and dark matter components that make up the
galaxy</p>
<h2 id="observable-host-properties">Observable Host Properties</h2>
<p>Properties of the <strong>host galaxy</strong> typically include: -
<strong>Stellar mass</strong> - Total mass in stars - <strong>Bulge
mass</strong> - Mass of the central stellar bulge -
<strong>Luminosity</strong> - Total light output across wavelengths -
<strong>Stellar velocity dispersion (σ)</strong> - Spread in stellar
velocities - <strong>Morphological type</strong> - Galaxy classification
(elliptical, spiral, etc.) - <strong>Gas content</strong> - Amount and
distribution of interstellar medium - <strong>Dark matter halo
properties</strong> - Halo mass and concentration</p>
<h2 id="standard-usage-in-literature">Standard Usage in Literature</h2>
<p>This terminology is standard in extragalactic astronomy, particularly
when discussing relationships such as: - <strong>Black hole mass
vs. host galaxy bulge mass</strong> - <strong>Black hole mass vs. host
galaxy velocity dispersion</strong> (the M–σ relation) - <strong>Black
hole–host coevolution</strong> scenarios - <strong>AGN feedback</strong>
and host galaxy quenching</p>
<h2 id="relevance-to-decoherence-framework">Relevance to Decoherence
Framework</h2>
<p>In the context of <em>Decoherence as First Principle</em>, the black
hole-host relationship takes on new meaning: - Both components may
emerge from shared <strong>gravitational decoherence events</strong> -
The <strong>co-evolution</strong> could reflect synchronized decoherence
processes rather than causal feedback - <strong>Scaling
relations</strong> might represent fundamental decoherence length and
time scales</p>
<p>This perspective suggests that black hole-host correlations arise
naturally from the decoherence bootstrap process, where both the central
compact object and the extended stellar system stabilize together as
gravitational pointer states.</p>

<p><em>Note: Understanding this terminology is essential for
interpreting observational studies of supermassive black holes and their
galactic environments.</em></p>
