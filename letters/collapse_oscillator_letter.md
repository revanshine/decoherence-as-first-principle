**Title:** Collapse-Length Oscillation and Conservation-Driven Cosmological Expansion: A Proposal

**Abstract:**
We propose a novel approach to reconciling discrepancies in cosmological measurements by modeling collapse-length dynamics as a damped harmonic oscillator coupled to a conservation law involving energy and entropy. In this framework, quantum decoherence is treated as a first principle with time-evolving collapse length, whose oscillatory behavior may contribute to perceived measurement anomalies such as redshift-distance tension. The formalism anchors itself in a conservation equation wherein the sum of classical energy in pointer states and scaled entropy remains invariant over time. We outline a testable system of coupled equations and propose the development of a simulation pipeline for model validation using public cosmological datasets.

**1. Introduction**
Recent tension between early- and late-time measurements of the Hubble constant invites reconsideration of underlying physical assumptions. We hypothesize that observed discrepancies may arise from time-evolving, nonlinear decoherence dynamics intrinsic to the universe’s quantum foundations. Decoherence as a first principle posits a finite collapse length, λ(t), governing the resolution of pointer states. As the universe ages, λ(t) evolves, potentially following an oscillatory decay profile whose effects accumulate along the light paths used for measurement.

**2. Theoretical Framework**
We model λ(t) as a damped harmonic oscillator:

  d^2λ/dt^2 + γ dλ/dt + ω^2 λ = 0

This represents the simplest nontrivial temporal evolution consistent with bounded energy and continuity assumptions. The key innovation is coupling this with a conservation law:

  d/dt (E_pointer + β S_total) = 0

where E_pointer is the total energy present in stable pointer states, S_total is total entropy, and β is a scaling constant encoding the effective temperature or gravitational redshifting of entropy-like degrees of freedom.

**3. Proposed Methodology**
To evaluate this framework, we aim to construct a data pipeline combining:
- Redshift-distance measurements and associated error estimates
- CMB anisotropy and large-scale structure data
- Simulated collapse-length oscillation profiles

Using this, we will compare standard cosmological predictions against those incorporating decoherence-induced distortions along photon paths.

**4. Implementation Strategy**
Our GitHub-hosted pipeline will leverage public cosmology libraries to parse redshift datasets, apply numerical solutions to the damped oscillator equation, and model effective deviations in light propagation. The system will be scalable to full-sky datasets with eventual cloud deployment contingent on grant funding.

**5. Conclusion**
We invite collaboration to explore this physically grounded, mathematically constrained hypothesis as a candidate explanation for cosmological tension. By connecting the evolution of quantum decoherence with classical observables via conservation laws, this approach offers a new lens for interpreting the structure and history of the universe.
