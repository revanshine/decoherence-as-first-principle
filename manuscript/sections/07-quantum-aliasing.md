# 7. Quantum Aliasing and Measurement Artefacts

In the decoherence bootstrap framework, reality is not a smooth, continuous fabric but a sequence of discrete decoherence events, separated by the *collapse length*. Just as a digital image can misrepresent a pattern when the sampling rate is too low (aliasing), our measurements can misinterpret physical processes when they occur near or beyond the resolution limit set by this collapse length. This draws a direct analogy to the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, where insufficient sampling produces artefacts not present in the underlying signal [@shannon1949, @nyquist1928].

**Aliasing in quantum systems** occurs when the temporal or spatial resolution of decoherence is insufficient to fully track a system’s underlying state evolution. In such cases, the “observed” state is a coarse-grained projection, and the interference patterns, tunneling probabilities, and entanglement correlations that we call *quantum phenomena* may be understood as the byproducts of this undersampling.

This reinterpretation suggests that:

- **Wave–particle duality** emerges because measurement interacts with an object’s decoherence sequence at irregular intervals, producing results that are effectively superpositions from the undersampled perspective.
- **Quantum interference** is the observable counterpart of sampling a system at phase offsets relative to its internal decoherence rhythm, allowing multiple possible histories to overlap in the measurement record.
- **Entanglement** represents synchronized aliasing between subsystems whose decoherence events remain correlated, so that undersampling one necessarily produces correlated undersampling in the other.
- **Quantum tunneling** can be reframed as a sampling artefact where the system’s state changes between decoherence events in a way that makes intermediate classical paths unresolvable.

From this perspective, the apparent “nonlocality” of quantum mechanics does not imply that information travels instantaneously, but rather that our observational frame rate is too low to capture all intermediate causal links. This aligns with the decoherence bootstrap’s view that **classicality emerges only when the collapse length is short enough** to resolve stable pointer states; in regimes where collapse length approaches or exceeds the relevant dynamical scales, aliasing dominates and quantum effects become manifest.^[Quantum weirdness may be a symptom of decoherence fatigue in a universe that was born classical.]

Ultimately, quantum aliasing offers a unifying interpretation: the phenomena we call “quantum” are not exceptions to classicality but signatures of a deeper, discretized structure of reality, where the limits of decoherence resolution define the limits of classical observation [@zurek2003, @schlosshauer2007].
