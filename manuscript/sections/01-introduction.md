# 1. Introduction

The quantum–classical boundary has long been treated as an epistemic artifact—a transition between microscopic indeterminacy and macroscopic determinism brought about by environmental measurement. In this work, we take a stronger stance: **decoherence is ontological**. The collapse of quantum superpositions is not merely a convenient description for observers but is instead a fundamental dynamical feature of reality’s fabric, setting the cadence at which “real” events occur.

This perspective gains urgency when considered alongside two of modern physics’ most persistent puzzles: the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity, and the nature of dark matter. Both domains are deeply concerned with the *structure of reality* at different scales, yet their current theoretical languages remain largely incompatible. We propose that treating decoherence as an ontological process—occurring in multiple “pointer bases” (e.g., gravitational, electromagnetic)—offers a route to reconciling these descriptions.

We introduce the **Decoherence Bootstrap Hypothesis**, which posits that the early universe emerged from a singularity-like state through a self-sustaining decoherence process that progressively lengthened the “collapse length” in different interaction bases. This sequence—gravitational → strong → electroweak → electromagnetic—provides a natural ordering for the emergence of forces without requiring ad hoc inflationary dynamics, while still accommodating the observed imprints in the cosmic microwave background.

From this perspective, black holes represent the inverse limit of the bootstrap: as matter spirals toward a singularity, the collapse length in the gravitational basis diverges, terminating the sequence of decoherence events and returning localized regions of reality to “singularity space.”

In what follows, we:

- Develop a quantitative framework linking collapse length to both decoherence rate and gravitational time dilation.
- Reinterpret dark matter as **mass decohered in the gravitational basis but not in the electromagnetic basis**, explaining its purely gravitational influence.
- Show how quantum phenomena can be recast as *aliasing artifacts* arising from the finite sampling frequency of reality itself.
- Connect the emergence of forces to conservation principles, proposing that the ordering of their appearance reflects an optimal pathway for dissipating the universe’s initial energy density.

By situating decoherence as the engine of cosmic structure, we aim to offer both a conceptual unification of gravity and quantum mechanics and a falsifiable set of predictions that touch observational cosmology, quantum information theory, and high-energy physics.
