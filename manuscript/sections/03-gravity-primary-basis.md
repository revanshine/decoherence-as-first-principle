# 3. Gravity as the Primary Decoherence Basis

In the decoherence bootstrap framework, gravity occupies a unique position as the **first and most fundamental decoherence channel**. This primacy arises from three key properties:

1. **Universality of coupling** — Unlike the other fundamental interactions, gravity couples to *all* forms of mass–energy without exception or shielding. No matter the quantum state’s composition, it necessarily interacts gravitationally with the rest of the universe.

2. **Geometric embodiment** — In general relativity, gravity is not a force in the gauge-field sense but the manifestation of spacetime curvature itself. Any emergent classical structure must therefore inherit a gravitational *pointer basis* before other interaction channels can stabilize.

3. **Dominance at Planck-scale densities** — In the earliest universe, energy densities approached the Planck scale, where gravitational effects become overwhelming relative to other forces. At these scales, spacetime curvature fluctuations dominate the decoherence environment [@penrose1994].

## 3.1 Gravity as the First Classical Frame

The curvature of spacetime is arguably the **first classical observable** to emerge. This observable defines the topology and metric properties of the universe, providing a *stage* upon which all subsequent interactions play out. In this sense, the gravitational pointer basis is not merely a passive backdrop—it is the **structural skeleton** of classical reality.

In the standard view, early-universe density perturbations are generated and amplified during inflation [@guth1981; @linde1982; @baumann2009], then *locked in* via gravitational decoherence before the electromagnetic pointer basis existed. In the decoherence bootstrap framework, this “locking in” can be explained even without inflation: **at the earliest moments the Collapse Length in the gravitational basis is extremely short**, i.e., decoherence events occur at ultra-high frequency across the primordial, nonlocal pre-classical state. This rapid, quasi-simultaneous gravitational decoherence can establish large-scale correlations without a separate inflationary phase, while still yielding the observed uniformity and coherence of the early universe [@steinhardt2002; @brandenberger2011].

Under either picture, the seeds of cosmic structure—visible in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies—reflect a gravitationally-set architecture established before electromagnetic observables existed.

*Boundary conditions summary:* the Big Bang corresponds to the **short-Collapse Length** limit (high-frequency decoherence initiating the chain), while black holes correspond to the **Collapse Length $\to \infty$** limit (termination of the chain in singularity space).

## 3.2 Pre-Electromagnetic Decoherence Epochs

Before the electromagnetic basis stabilized, mass–energy could decohere purely in the gravitational channel. Such matter would remain **invisible** to any later EM-based detection, interacting only through its gravitational influence. This provides a natural, first-principles path to the dark matter reinterpretation developed in Section 5 [@zwicky1933; @rubin1970; @rubin1980].

We define the **gravitational pointer basis** as the set of states whose decoherence is determined solely by spacetime curvature, independent of gauge interactions. In this framework, the earliest decohered mass–energy becomes “dark” not because it is exotic, but because it is **pre-EM classical**—its history is locked in before electromagnetic observables existed.

In summary, gravity’s universality, geometric nature, and dominance in the high-energy early universe position it as the first and most stable decoherence channel. The gravitational pointer basis shapes the earliest classical structure and predetermines the large-scale architecture of the universe before other forces even emerge.
