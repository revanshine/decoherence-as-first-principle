Direct vs consensus — Direct claim.
Where — PRL 14, 57–59; open PDF.

9) Gell-Mann (1964): Quark model

Use — Establishes the strong-sector microstructure referenced when you sequence force emergence.

11) Glashow (1961): Partial symmetries of weak interactions

Use — Pre-unification scaffold used in your narrative about electroweak emergence.
Direct vs consensus — Direct claim (model paper).
Where — Nuclear Physics 22, 579–588; ScienceDirect record / accessible copies.

12) Weinberg (1967): A Model of Leptons

Use — Electroweak unification cornerstone; you cite it as the formal consolidation preceding Higgs discovery.
Direct vs consensus — Direct claim.
Where — PRL 19, 1264–1266; APS page / PDF copies.

Use — Strong-interaction running (high-energy weakening) backing your sequencing of force stabilization.
Direct vs consensus — Direct claim.
Where — PRL 30, 1343–1346; APS page/PDF.

Use — Independent derivation confirming #13; strengthens the QCD pillar in Sec. 4.
Direct vs consensus — Direct claim.
Where — PRL 30, 1346–1349; APS page/PDF.

Use — Thermal field-theory basis for your “decoherence thresholds”/epoch sequencing (high-T restoration).
Direct vs consensus — Direct claim.
Where — Phys. Rev. D 9, 3357–3378; APS/OSTI copies.

16) Hawking & Ellis (1973): The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time

Use — Global GR framework & singularity/collapse chapters that your black-hole boundary condition leans on.
Direct vs consensus — Consensus anchor (graduate-level treatise).
Where — Cambridge monograph; see Ch. 8 “Space-time singularities,” Ch. 9 “Gravitational collapse and black holes.”
