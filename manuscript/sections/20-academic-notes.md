# Academic Notes

This section is an internal working addendum to track mastery of all referenced material and ensure the intellectual integrity of the manuscript.

## Engagement Goals
1. **Read all sources** in full text, not just abstracts or quoted passages.
2. **Extract primary reasoning** from each, noting where interpretations diverge from original intent.
3. **Reproduce or verify derivations** where applicable (math, plots, or physical models).
4. **Create supplemental diagrams or summaries** to integrate into this manuscript as original contributions.
5. **Track completion** in the Citations Mastery Tracker.

## Outcome
Once complete, this process will ensure:

- Every citation is fully understood and accurately represented.
- The manuscript reflects original engagement rather than derivative interpretation.
- A defensible position for authorship and potential academic submission.
