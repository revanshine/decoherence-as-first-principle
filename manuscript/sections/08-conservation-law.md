# 8. Toward a Conservation Law for Decoherence

We now propose a working principle: the evolution of Collapse Length is governed by a conservation law linking energy, entropy, and decoherence dynamics. In this view, the universe is not only conserving energy and momentum in the conventional sense—it is also conserving a **joint energy–entropy quantity** that determines how quantum-to-classical transitions proceed.

In the decoherence bootstrap framework, the path from the shortest possible Collapse Length at the Big Bang to the infinite Collapse Length at a black hole singularity is not arbitrary. It follows a trajectory that optimally dissipates the initial “heat” of the singularity into long-lived classical structures. The ordering of force emergence—gravity $\to$ strong $\to$ electroweak $\to$ electromagnetic—is then interpretable as **the optimal sequence for shedding coherence energy into increasingly specialized and low-loss channels**.

- **Gravity first**: universal coupling, maximal reach, sets the global spacetime scaffold for further dissipation.
- **Strong force**: locks matter into bound states, trapping most rest mass-energy efficiently and stably.
- **Electroweak**: permits massive particle decay channels and fine-tunes charge and spin configurations.
- **Electromagnetism**: final, low-energy pointer basis that supports persistent information encoding and radiative dissipation.

From this standpoint, what we call “reality” is the byproduct of a maximal-efficiency cascade: a system that began in a state of shortest Collapse Length—high-frequency decoherence, zero persistence—has evolved along a path that balances energy disposal with the retention of coherent structures.

If this conservation principle is valid, it should leave signatures in:

- The relative timescales of force decoupling as imprinted in CMB anisotropies.
- The statistical distribution of bound versus unbound matter across cosmic history.
- Deviations from $\Lambda$CDM predictions in early structure formation, reflecting constraints imposed by collapse-length conservation.

Formally, this could be expressed as:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\!\left(E_{\text{classical}} + \alpha\, S_{\text{decoherence}}\right)=0
$$

where $E_{\text{classical}}$ is the energy stored in persistent pointer states, $S_{\text{decoherence}}$ is the entropy associated with collapse events, and $\alpha$ is a scaling factor determined by the collapse-length dynamics.

This formulation also closes the symmetry between the Big Bang and black holes: the former is the point of maximal decoherence frequency (Collapse Length $\to 0$), while the latter is the point of minimal decoherence frequency (Collapse Length $\to \infty$), both representing boundary conditions in the same conservation law.
