# 2. The Decoherence Bootstrap Hypothesis

We propose that the Big Bang can be understood as a Boltzmann-like fluctuation [@boltzmann1896; @boltzmann1896english] that achieved a **sustainable decoherence cascade** — a self-propagating sequence of events in which quantum superpositions were progressively reduced to stable classical pointer states [@zurek2003; @schlosshauer2007]. This process, which we term the *decoherence bootstrap*, reframes the origin of the universe not as an uncontrolled explosion from a singularity, but as the initiation of a chain reaction in the “Collapse Length” of reality.

In the earliest instants after this fluctuation, the **decoherence chain length** was vanishingly short: superpositions could not persist over any meaningful scale, and no stable physical structures or forces could emerge. This brevity imposed a unification of all interactions — the system lacked the persistence to differentiate between bases such as electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravitation [@weinberg1974; @guth1981]. In this regime, the only physically meaningful structure was the quantum state of the whole.

The bootstrap succeeded because the Collapse Length began to grow — whether through an intrinsic thermodynamic instability [@prigogine1984], amplification of quantum fluctuations [@mukhanov1981], or a deep statistical bias in the space of possible microstates. As decoherence events chained together over longer separations, specific interaction bases could stabilize. Gravity, being universally coupled and insensitive to charge or spin [@misner1973], is hypothesized to have been the first decoherence channel to achieve persistence. Subsequent forces emerged only once the decoherence chain could support their more delicate pointer states [@zurek2003].

The sustainability of this bootstrap is nontrivial. Not all fluctuations would have resulted in a growing Collapse Length; most would recede into singularity space, never establishing a classical history. The fact that our universe’s decoherence chain lengthened, diversified, and stabilized interaction channels implies an underlying asymmetry — possibly rooted in the low-entropy boundary conditions at the origin [@penrose1989]. This marks the Big Bang as the **boundary condition where Collapse Length was at its shortest**, in symmetry with black hole singularities as the **boundary condition where Collapse Length becomes infinite**.

This perspective suggests that the “laws of physics” are not immutable axioms but **emergent features** of a decoherence network that reached a self-sustaining phase. The forces, particles, and spacetime fabric we observe are therefore contingent on the success of this bootstrap. In the absence of sustained decoherence, reality collapses back into the undifferentiated potential of singularity space, as is hypothesized to occur in black hole interiors [@hawking1976].
