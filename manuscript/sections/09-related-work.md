# 9. Related Work

Several established lines of research intersect with—and provide context for—the present framework.
Below, we summarize each strand, note points of contact, and highlight divergences.

- **Emergent/Entropic Gravity** — Gravity as a thermodynamic or entropic phenomenon has been explored by Jacobson [@jacobson1995], Padmanabhan [@padmanabhan2010], and Verlinde [@verlinde2011].
  These approaches treat spacetime curvature as an emergent effect of entropy gradients or information flow, often grounded in holographic principles.
  *Relation*: Our framework also links gravity to fundamental information processes—here, the earliest and most universal decoherence basis.
  *Difference*: We treat thermodynamic behavior as *derivative* of decoherence chain sustainability, rather than the source of spacetime itself.

- **Emergent Time from Quantum Information** — Page & Wootters [@page1983] and Moreva et al. [@moreva2014] model time as emerging from correlations in quantum states or growth in computational complexity.
  *Relation*: Our model likewise regards time as emergent, specifically from the sequence of stable decoherence events.
  *Difference*: We tie the “clock” to the *Collapse Length* between events, allowing time to decouple from coordinate duration and vanish in hyper-decoherence regimes such as black holes or the Big Bang.

- **Consistent/Decoherent Histories & Quantum Darwinism** — Gell-Mann & Hartle [@gellmann1990] and Zurek [@zurek2009] explain classical reality as a selection of stable pointer states from quantum possibilities, maintained by environment-induced decoherence.
  *Relation*: We adopt the pointer basis concept directly, with gravity as the first environment to stabilize any basis at all.
  *Difference*: We frame this as a cosmological bootstrap, where sequential stabilization of pointer bases defines force emergence and accounts for dark matter.

- **Gravity-Induced Collapse Models** — Diósi [@diosi1987] and Penrose [@penrose1996] propose that gravity itself triggers wavefunction collapse, setting a fundamental scale for quantum/classical transition.
  *Relation*: Our view is compatible with gravity being a universal decoherence channel.
  *Difference*: We extend this to a full force-emergence chronology and interpret dark matter as matter collapsed gravitationally before EM basis formation.

- **Black-Hole–Driven Decoherence** — Danielson, Satishchandran & Wald [@danielson2023; @danielson2025], Gralla [@gralla2023], and Biggs & Maldacena [@biggs2024] show how horizons and black holes decohere spatial superpositions through horizon quanta and field correlations.
  *Relation*: We agree that black holes are extreme decoherence environments.
  *Difference*: We reinterpret them as *termination points* of the decoherence chain, where Collapse Length diverges and classicality fails to emerge, yielding informational turbulence rather than mere information loss.

**Summary of Distinction**

Our framework integrates multiple research strands into a single ontological model centered on **Collapse Length** and the sustainability of the decoherence chain, yielding three defining distinctions:

- **Dual Extremes of Decoherence** — Both the Big Bang and black hole singularities represent hyper-decoherence, yet differ fundamentally in origin, boundary conditions, and cosmological role.
- **Opposite Causal Functions** — The Big Bang’s hyper-decoherence launches spacetime and the sequence of emergent forces; a black hole’s hyper-decoherence dismantles existing coherent structures.
- **Inverted Entropy Flow** — The Big Bang drives entropy outward into the cosmos; black hole singularities draw entropy inward, reversing their thermodynamic roles in cosmic evolution.
