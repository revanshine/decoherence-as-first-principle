# 6. Black Holes and the Decoherence Limit

Black holes represent the terminal state of decoherence within our observable universe [@penrose1965; @hawking1973]. As gravitational collapse proceeds beyond the event horizon, matter spirals inward through increasingly extreme regimes of classical spacetime until the separation between decoherence events—the **Collapse Length**—stretches toward infinity [@zurek2003]. In this limit, no further decoherence occurs; the chain of classical reality frames terminates, and all that remains is *singularity space*.

This framing makes it possible to distinguish the black hole singularity from the Big Bang in precise terms. Both mark a transition between singularity space and classical reality, but in opposite directions: the Big Bang is the **boundary condition where Collapse Length was at its shortest**, launching reality; the black hole singularity is the **boundary condition where Collapse Length becomes infinite**, ending it. The Big Bang corresponds to the initiation of a sustainable decoherence chain—a Boltzmann-like fluctuation [@boltzmann1896; @boltzmann1896english] that successfully bootstrapped a self-propagating sequence of classical frames. The black hole singularity marks the *end* of such a chain, where decoherence ceases because the Collapse Length has become infinite.

Energy density alone does not differentiate these transitions; in the mathematical limit, both approach the same curvature singularity [@misner1973]. The decisive difference lies in entropy. The Big Bang began in a low-entropy, high-potential configuration capable of sustaining branching decoherence events [@penrose1989]. The black hole singularity represents the exhaustion of entropy’s gradient—an endpoint where informational degrees of freedom no longer evolve [@bekenstein1973; @hawking1976].

From this perspective, reality exists only where decoherence continues at finite Collapse Lengths. Time, locality, and measurement all derive from this persistence. Inside a black hole, what appears as gravitational collapse is in fact a topological transition from classical spacetime back into singularity space. The interior is not an informational furnace nor a chaotic hyper-decoherent zone, but a **coherence-starved boundary**—a terminal condition for the physics of reality itself.
