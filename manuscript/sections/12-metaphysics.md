### Interpretive Possibility: The Origin Event

We observe a universe that expands, contains mass, has stable causal order, and exhibits decoherence-driven transitions from quantum indeterminacy to classical structure. The Standard Model explains nearly everything within that structure—but not where it came from.

The earliest consistent boundary condition implied by this framework is one of **maximal decoherence**: collapse length near zero, causal resolution at its peak. No stable particle field exists prior to this. No space, no energy as we define it. Decoherence itself marks the first act of physics.

**And yet, something decohered.**

This origin event need not be described by any known particle or interaction. It would have existed *outside causal structure*—since causality itself depends on decoherence. Whatever collapsed in that primordial moment left behind a memory: one that set collapse length to its minimum, and thereby seeded all emergent forces.

That memory is felt today as gravity.

This is not a claim of a specific origin particle, nor a call to expand the Standard Model to include unmeasured speculation. But it is a pointer: **if the universe behaves as though it remembers a single decoherence event—universal, energetic, and irreversible—then we may be looking at the imprint of a nonrecurring fluctuation.**

What collapsed is unknowable.
What followed is measurable.

What followed was measurable — because it became through measurement. A chain reaction of decoherence events, each collapsing uncertainty into classical structure, propagated forward. Not merely observed reality, but reality as observation: a universe igniting into being through its own capacity to be known.
