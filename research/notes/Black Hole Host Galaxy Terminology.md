# Black Hole Host Galaxy Terminology

## Definition of "Host"

In the phrase **"black hole and host"** (especially in the context of galaxies), the term **host** almost always refers to the **host galaxy**—that is, the galaxy which contains the black hole, typically a *supermassive black hole* at its center.

## What "Host" Encompasses

**"Host" in this context means:**
- The **entire galaxy** that surrounds and includes the central black hole
- The gravitational and dynamical environment in which the black hole resides
- The stellar, gas, and dark matter components that make up the galaxy

## Observable Host Properties

Properties of the **host galaxy** typically include:
- **Stellar mass** - Total mass in stars
- **Bulge mass** - Mass of the central stellar bulge
- **Luminosity** - Total light output across wavelengths
- **Stellar velocity dispersion (σ)** - Spread in stellar velocities
- **Morphological type** - Galaxy classification (elliptical, spiral, etc.)
- **Gas content** - Amount and distribution of interstellar medium
- **Dark matter halo properties** - Halo mass and concentration

## Standard Usage in Literature

This terminology is standard in extragalactic astronomy, particularly when discussing relationships such as:
- **Black hole mass vs. host galaxy bulge mass**
- **Black hole mass vs. host galaxy velocity dispersion** (the M–σ relation)
- **Black hole–host coevolution** scenarios
- **AGN feedback** and host galaxy quenching

## Relevance to Decoherence Framework

In the context of *Decoherence as First Principle*, the black hole-host relationship takes on new meaning:
- Both components may emerge from shared **gravitational decoherence events**
- The **co-evolution** could reflect synchronized decoherence processes rather than causal feedback
- **Scaling relations** might represent fundamental decoherence length and time scales

This perspective suggests that black hole-host correlations arise naturally from the decoherence bootstrap process, where both the central compact object and the extended stellar system stabilize together as gravitational pointer states.

*Note: Understanding this terminology is essential for interpreting observational studies of supermassive black holes and their galactic environments.*
