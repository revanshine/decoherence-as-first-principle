# The M–σ Relation in Galaxy Formation

## Definition and Physical Meaning

In the context of the **M–σ relation** in astrophysics, **σ** (sigma) refers to the **stellar velocity dispersion**. This term describes the *spread* in the velocities of stars—essentially, how quickly stars are moving around—in the central region (usually the bulge) of a galaxy.

## Key Parameters

**σ = velocity dispersion**: 
- A statistical measure (standard deviation) of the speeds at which stars are moving
- Typically measured in kilometers per second (km/s)
- Higher σ indicates faster and more chaotic stellar motion in that region

**M = black hole mass**:
- Mass of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy
- Usually expressed in solar masses ($M_\odot$)

## The Empirical Relation

The **M–σ relation** is expressed as:

$$
M_{\rm BH} \propto \sigma^p
$$

where:
- $M_{\rm BH}$ is the supermassive black hole mass
- $\sigma$ is the stellar velocity dispersion in the galactic bulge
- $p$ is an empirical constant (typically between 4 and 5)

This empirical law links the mass of a galaxy's central black hole to the velocity dispersion of the stars in the galactic bulge.

## Significance in Cosmology

The M–σ relation is one of the most important scaling relations in galaxy formation theory, suggesting a fundamental connection between:
- Central black hole growth
- Bulge formation processes
- Overall galaxy evolution

## Connection to Decoherence Framework

In the context of the *Decoherence as First Principle* framework, the M–σ relation may reflect:
- **Co-evolution through decoherence**: Both SMBH growth and stellar velocity dispersion could emerge from the same early gravitational decoherence events
- **Gravitational pointer states**: The relation might represent the stabilization of gravitational configurations through decoherence processes
- **Scale-invariant decoherence**: The power-law form suggests underlying scale-invariant decoherence mechanisms

This provides an alternative to traditional feedback models, where the correlation arises naturally from shared decoherence history rather than causal feedback loops.

*Note: This relation is central to understanding the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, and may provide observational constraints for decoherence-based cosmological models.*
